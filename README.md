### â€¢ Content

In addition to attributes powered by [Data Attributes: Directors Cut](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/data-attributes-directors-cut), PlayerEX: Directors Cut adds a levelling system and skill points to spend, enabled through a nonintrusive vanilla-styled gui accessible from the inventory or by hotkey.
